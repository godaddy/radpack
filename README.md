## What is it?

> Infusing the greatest benefits of modern bundlers (Webpack, Rollup) and loaders (SystemJS, RequireJS)
> into an all-inclusive build and run-time solution optimized for the end-user experience.

Bundlers like Webpack do a great job at providing a toolset needed to
deliver an optimal out-of-the-box delivery solution for your end-users.
Most loaders on the other hand, are focused on delivering only the requested
assets, as they are needed. Radpack fuses the best of both worlds
by taking advantage of build-time bundling, with graph-based run-time loading.

## Examples
[Several application, client, and library examples](./examples/)


## Publishing
Each package independently manages its semver and is updated using [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). Run `npx lerna publish` to [publish](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/main/commands/publish) all modified packages, or run `npx lerna version <semver type>` in each package you want to individually [version bump](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/main/commands/version) and then at the root run `npx lerna publish from-package`.
